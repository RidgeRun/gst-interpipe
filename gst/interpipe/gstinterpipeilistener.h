 *
 * @get_name: Return the name of the object implementing the
 *   interface.  See #gst_inter_pipe_ilistener_get_name.
 *
 * @get_caps: Return the set of supported caps. The element
 *   implementing the interface should consider it's downstream
 *   capabilities. Additionally, it should output through the
 *   @negotiated variable whether or not caps are already configured in
 *   the element. See #gst_inter_pipe_ilistener_get_caps.
 *
 * @set_caps: Configure the given caps into the element. This caps
 * should be forwarded to downstream elements. See
 * #gst_inter_pipe_ilistener_set_caps.
 *
 * @node_added: Callback function that will be called whenever a new
 * node is connected. It's responsibility of the listener to decide
 * whether or not it is interested in the new node. See
 * #gst_inter_pipe_ilistener_node_added.
 *
 * @node_removed: Callback function that will be called whenever a
 * node is disconnected. It's responsibility of the listener to decide
 * whether or not it is interested in the node removal. See
 * #gst_inter_pipe_ilistener_node_removed.
 *
 * @push_buffer: Push the given buffer into the listener's
 * pipeline. Furthermore, consider @basetime in order to compensate
 * its timestamp if required. See
 * #gst_inter_pipe_ilistener_push_buffer.
 *
 * @push_event: Push the given event into the listener's
 * pipeline. Furthermore, consider @basetime in order to compensate
 * its timestamp if required. See
 * #gst_inter_pipe_ilistener_push_event.
 *
 * @send_eos: Send an EOS event into the listener's pipeline. See
 * #gst_inter_pipe_ilistener_send_eos.
